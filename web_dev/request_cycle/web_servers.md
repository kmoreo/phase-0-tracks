Release 1: Research Web Servers

1. What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
--> Linux puts a great deal of power in the hands of the user and allows everyone the ability to tell the computer to do whatever they want.
-->	Linux is developed as a group effort by global Internet users; there is no single organization responsible for developing the system 

2. In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
--> A VPS is a virtual machine that is sold to a user than can run any OS they choose and install any software they want and use it to accept HTTP requests; they can be advantageous since they are cheaper to run, they are easier to experiement with, and there is no liability for maintaining and repairing hardware.

3. Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
--> Root operates as a "superuser" and can perform any function, destructive and nondestructive alike. It is advisable to restrict root usage to administrative tasks needed, and to run everything else as a specific user.
