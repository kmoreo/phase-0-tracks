# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way of keeping track of changes made to documents. It is useful in that it allows a user to see what changes were made, when they were made, and who made them.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch creates a copy of a project to be worked on. It's advisable to use branches in order to test changes before merging them into the final version.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a saved change to a document. A good commit message clearly identifies what was changed.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when the same part of a file is made in two different branches and then later those branches are merged together.
