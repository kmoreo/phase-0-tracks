<!--What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	HTML5 semantic tags give more meaning to the information displayed in a file. The semantic tags do not typically affect how the text is rendered, but it can depending on the device and/or browser being used. Personally, I think the <main>, <section>, and <nav> tags are the most useful.-->

<!--What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	The elements are displayed on the page in the same order in which they appear in the HTML text. The browser does not reorder the information based on the element being used.-->

<!--What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	It was easier to create a snippet than I thought. I will definitely keep it in mind if I find myself entering the same information over and over. Or maybe I'll make a snippet with a fun dinosaur image and add it to every page I make. Sort of like an awesome digital signature.-->

<!--What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	The most difficult thing for me was/is knowing exactly what the difference is between some of the semantic tags. Based on my guide's input and what I've read about how new these rules are I don't think there is one concrete way of using these tags, and it will mostly depend on my personal style. I'll try viewing the HTML for pages I visit in the future to see these semantic tags in use so that I can gain a better understanding of when and how to use them. And Googling examples.
