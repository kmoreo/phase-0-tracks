# User 1 inputs a secret word.
# Number of guesses is set to 2x word length.
# User 2 enters a guess of a letter.
# Program checks to see if guessed letter is in the secret word.
# If the letter guessed has been guessed previously, the guess count does not increment.
# If the letter guessed has not been guess previously, the guess count increments by 1.
# If the letter is in the word, the letter is printed to the screen in its appropriate place.
# If the letter is not in the word, the appropriate number of blank spaces is printed to the screen with no letter revealed.
# Repeat with guesses until number of guesses is reached, or word is guessed, whichever comes first.
# Print congratulatory/taunting message based on outcome.
